- using `exiftool <filename>`
- Found a username: OWoodflint
- Googling that I found Twitter and GitHub profiles
- On Twitter they mention a BSSID: B4:5D:50:AA:86:41
- Registered an account on wigle.net to perform an advanced search on the BSSID and find where it's located: https://wigle.net/search?netid=B4%3A5D%3A50%3AAA%3A86%3A41#fullSearch
https://wigle.net/search#detailSearch?netid=B4%3A5D%3A50%3AAA%3A86%3A41
- Can see there the name of IPS: UnileverWiFi
- On GitHub the email address and a wordpress site are exposed
- The wordpress is currently down but through archive.org I found its old version.
-  The password was hidden in the source of the wordpress: didn't make much sense to me...
